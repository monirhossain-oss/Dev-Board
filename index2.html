                <h3>Question-1: What are the different ways to select an element in the DOM?
                </h3>
                <p><span class="font-bold">Answer:</span> There are several ways to select an element in the DOM: getElementById() selects an element by its ID, getElementsByClassName() selects elements by class name, and getElementsByTagName() selects elements by tag name. querySelector() selects the first matching element using a CSS selector, while querySelectorAll() selects all matching elements. Among these, querySelector() and querySelectorAll() are the most flexible since they allow selection based on complex CSS selectors.</p>

                <h3>Question-2: What is the difference between innerHTML, innerText, and textContent ?
                </h3>
                <p><span class="font-bold">Answer:</span> `innerHTML`, `innerText`, and `textContent` are used to get or modify content inside an element, but they work differently. `innerHTML` retrieves or sets the HTML inside an element, meaning it processes and renders HTML tags. `innerText` gets or sets only the visible text, ignoring hidden elements and considering CSS styles. `textContent` retrieves or sets all text inside an element, including hidden content, without processing HTML. `textContent` is faster and safer than `innerHTML` since it does not execute scripts or render HTML.</p>

                <h3>Question-3: What is event delegation in the DOM?
                </h3>
                <p><span class="font-bold">Answer:</span> Event delegation is a technique in JavaScript where a parent element listens for events on its child elements using event bubbling. Instead of adding event listeners to multiple child elements, a single event listener is placed on a common ancestor. When an event occurs on a child, it propagates up the DOM tree, and the parent handles it using `event.target` to determine which child triggered the event. This improves performance and is useful for dynamically added elements.</p>

                <h3>Question-4: What is event bubbling in the DOM?
                </h3>
                <p><span class="font-bold">Answer:</span> Event bubbling is a process in the DOM where an event starts from the target element and propagates up through its ancestors. For example, if a button inside a `<div>` is clicked, the event first triggers on the button, then bubbles up to the `<div>`, and continues up to the `<body>` and `document`. This allows parent elements to listen for events on their child elements. Bubbling can be controlled using `event.stopPropagation()` to prevent it from reaching higher elements.</p>
